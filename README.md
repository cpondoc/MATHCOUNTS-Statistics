# MATHCOUNTS Statistics
Analyzing the statistics behind MATHCOUNTS in order to optimize teaching, training, and performance.
# Motivation
A lot of the motivation for this project came from Daryl Morey, General Manager of the Houston Rockets. In recent years, it has been reported that his team utilizes extensive data analytics in order to help optimize the amount of points scored, specifically as it pertains to shooting more 3-pointers.

With data science becoming more intertwined with sports, it seemed fitting to attempt to utilize simple statistical analyses to try and optimize the performance of students at West Frederick Middle School MATHCOUNTS, specifically in terms of analyzing by grade and round type.
